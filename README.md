Scripts for manipulating obf<->mcp<->cb mappings on Minecraft jars

* obf = vanilla Minecraft obfuscation, as in binaries shipped by Mojang ("notch" names)
* mcp = descriptive deobfuscation from Minecraft Coder Pack decompilation ("mapped" or "csv" names)
* pkgmcp = same as mcp, but classes are in packages, and includes client and server (used in FML/Forge)
* num = numeric symbol names from MCP, intended for consistency across versions ("srg" names)
* numpkg = same as num, but classes are in packages (used in FML/Forge runtime deobfuscation)
* cb = partial deobfuscation from mc-dev, used in CraftBukkit source (Bukkit team names)
* vcb = same as cb, but with versioned package names, used in compiled CraftBukkit>=1.4.5-R1 (Maven shaded names)
